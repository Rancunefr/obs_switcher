# obs_switcher
obs_switcher

A little cli helper to toggle visibility on a scene item in obs-studio.
It uses the latest websocket protocol.

# Usage : 

obs_switcher <scene> <source> <true | false>

# WARNING :
I don't know RUST. Not even basics. I only did this to have a solution for my streams,
but a true rustacean would probably have a severe PTSD after reading this code. Don't
trust it in any way.
